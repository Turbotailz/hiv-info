Many people use the terms "HIV" and "AIDS" interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. This page clarifies the distinction between HIV and AIDS and explains the stages of HIV infection.

## What is HIV?

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4+ T cells (also known as T helper cells), which are crucial for fighting off infections. Over time, HIV can weaken the immune system, making the body vulnerable to various illnesses.

## What is AIDS?

AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. It is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. A person is diagnosed with AIDS when their immune system is severely damaged, and they develop certain opportunistic infections or cancers.

**Key point:**  Having HIV does not mean a person has AIDS. With proper treatment, people with HIV can live long and healthy lives without ever developing AIDS.

## Stages of HIV Infection

The progression of HIV infection is typically divided into three stages:

### 1. Acute HIV Infection

This is the initial stage of infection, shortly after someone contracts HIV.

*   **Symptoms:** Many people experience flu-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, sore throat, rash) during this stage. However, some people may have no symptoms at all.
*   **Viral Load:** The amount of HIV in the blood is very high during this stage, making the person highly contagious.
*   **Testing:**  HIV may not be detectable by standard tests immediately after infection (window period).

### 2. Chronic HIV Infection (Clinical Latency)

This stage can last for many years, even decades, with effective treatment.

*   **Symptoms:**  People may experience no or few symptoms during this stage.
*   **Viral Load:**  HIV is still active but reproduces at lower levels.
*   **Treatment:** Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial during this stage to keep the viral load low, protect the immune system, and prevent progression to AIDS.

### 3. AIDS

This is the most severe stage of HIV infection.

*   **Symptoms:**  People with AIDS experience a range of opportunistic infections and cancers that take advantage of the weakened immune system.
*   **CD4+ T Cell Count:**  The number of CD4+ T cells drops significantly (below 200 cells/mm3).
*   **Treatment:**  ART is essential to manage AIDS and prolong life. However, the immune system is severely compromised, making individuals susceptible to serious health complications.

## Preventing HIV Progression to AIDS

Early diagnosis and treatment with ART are crucial for preventing HIV from progressing to AIDS. ART helps to:

*   Reduce the viral load to undetectable levels.
*   Protect and restore the immune system.
*   Prevent opportunistic infections.
*   Improve quality of life.
*   Prevent HIV transmission.
