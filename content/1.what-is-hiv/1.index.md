This page provides a foundational understanding of HIV, covering its basic biology, how it impacts the body, and the history of this virus.

## What is HIV?
HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It's a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4+ T cells (also known as T helper cells). These cells are vital for fighting off infections and diseases. Over time, HIV weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to defend itself.

### How HIV Works

HIV is a retrovirus, which means it uses RNA as its genetic material. When HIV enters the body, it attaches to CD4+ T cells and takes over their machinery to make copies of itself. These new copies then go on to infect other cells, gradually destroying the immune system.

## The HIV Life Cycle
(Include a simple diagram illustrating the HIV life cycle here)

The HIV life cycle can be broken down into several key steps:

1. Binding and Entry: HIV binds to the surface of a CD4+ T cell and enters the cell.
2. Reverse Transcription: HIV converts its RNA into DNA.
3. Integration: The HIV DNA integrates into the host cell's DNA.
4. Transcription: The integrated HIV DNA is used to create new viral RNA.
5. Translation: The viral RNA is translated into viral proteins.
6. Assembly: New HIV particles are assembled.
7. Budding: New HIV particles bud off from the host cell, ready to infect other cells.

## Different Types of HIV

There are two main types of HIV:

- **HIV-1:** This is the most common type of HIV found worldwide.
- **HIV-2:** This type is less common and is mainly found in West Africa.

While both types can cause AIDS, HIV-2 tends to progress more slowly.

## A Brief History of HIV/AIDS
- **Early 1980s:** The first cases of what would later be known as AIDS are identified in the United States.
- **1983:** Scientists isolate the virus responsible for AIDS, which is later named HIV.
- **1987:** The first antiretroviral drug, AZT, is approved for use in people with HIV.
- **1990s:** The development of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly improves the treatment of HIV and the outlook for people living with the virus.
- **Today:** While there is still no cure for HIV, ART allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives and prevents sexual transmission of the virus.
