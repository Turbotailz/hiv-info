We understand you may have questions about HIV. This page provides clear and accurate answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.

## Can I get HIV from casual contact, like hugging, kissing, or sharing utensils?

No, HIV is not transmitted through casual contact. You cannot get HIV from sharing food, drinks, utensils, toilets, swimming pools, or hugging someone with HIV. HIV is only transmitted through specific bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.

## Are only certain groups of people at risk of HIV?

Anyone can get HIV, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Certain behaviors, such as unprotected sex and sharing needles, can increase the risk of HIV transmission.

## Can I tell if someone has HIV just by looking at them?

No, many people with HIV show no symptoms for years. The only way to know if someone has HIV is through an HIV test.

## If I'm taking PrEP, do I still need to use condoms?

Yes, even though PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV, it's still important to use condoms. Condoms protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that PrEP does not prevent.

## Is there any point in getting tested for HIV if there is no cure?

Absolutely. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for people with HIV. With effective treatment, people with HIV can live long and healthy lives and prevent transmission to others.

## Is HIV a death sentence?

No. With advances in treatment, HIV is now a manageable chronic condition. People with HIV can live long and fulfilling lives.

## I've heard that HIV can be transmitted through mosquito bites. Is that true?

No, HIV cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites or any other insects. Insects do not carry the virus in their saliva.

## Can I get HIV from donating blood?

No, you cannot get HIV from donating blood. Sterile needles and equipment are used for each donation, eliminating any risk of transmission.

## If my partner has an undetectable viral load, can we have sex without condoms?

Yes, when someone living with HIV has an undetectable viral load due to effective treatment, they cannot transmit HIV sexually. This is known as U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable).

### Can it be detected in regular blood tests?

### Can Prep mask it from appearing in a blood test?

### Can someone who is undetectable have children?
