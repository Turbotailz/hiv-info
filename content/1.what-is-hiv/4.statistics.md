Statistics play a vital role in understanding the impact of HIV/AIDS and guiding prevention and treatment efforts. This page provides an overview of key HIV statistics on a global and regional level.

## Global HIV Statistics

(Source your statistics from reputable organizations like UNAIDS, WHO, or the CDC. Include the year the data refers to.)

*   **People living with HIV:**  Approximately 39.9 million people were living with HIV worldwide in 2023.
*   **New HIV infections:** An estimated 1.3 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2023.
*   **AIDS-related deaths:**  Around 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2023.
*   **Access to treatment:**  About 30.7 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2023.

## Regional HIV Statistics

The HIV epidemic affects different regions of the world differently. Here's a brief overview of some key regions:

*   **Sub-Saharan Africa:** This region remains the most affected by HIV, accounting for a disproportionate share of new infections and AIDS-related deaths.
*   **Eastern Europe and Central Asia:** This region has experienced a concerning increase in new HIV infections in recent years.
*   **Asia and the Pacific:**  This region is home to a diverse range of HIV epidemics, with some countries making significant progress while others face ongoing challenges.
*   **Latin America and the Caribbean:**  This region has made progress in reducing new infections and improving access to treatment.
*   **Western and Central Europe and North America:**  New infections and AIDS-related deaths have declined significantly in this region due to effective prevention and treatment programs.

## Key Trends and Progress

*   **Decline in new infections:**  Globally, new HIV infections have declined significantly since the peak of the epidemic.
*   **Increased access to treatment:**  More people than ever before are accessing life-saving ART.
*   **Reduced AIDS-related deaths:**  AIDS-related deaths have decreased substantially due to improved treatment and care.

## Challenges and Future Directions

*   **Stigma and discrimination:**  Stigma continues to be a barrier to HIV prevention and treatment in many parts of the world.
*   **Inequalities in access:**  Disparities in access to healthcare and treatment persist, particularly in marginalized communities.
*   **Prevention gaps:**  More needs to be done to scale up effective prevention interventions, such as PrEP and comprehensive sexual health education.

## The Importance of Data

HIV statistics provide valuable insights into the current state of the epidemic and help to guide prevention and treatment efforts. By tracking progress and identifying challenges, we can work towards ending HIV/AIDS as a global health threat.
