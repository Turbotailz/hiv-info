Getting tested for HIV is an important step in taking care of your health. This page explains what your test results mean, including the window period, confirmatory testing, and what to do if you receive a positive result.

## Types of HIV Test Results

### Negative Result

A negative HIV test result means that no antibodies or antigens to HIV were detected in your blood or oral fluid sample. This usually means you are not infected with HIV.

**Important note:** There is a "window period" with HIV tests. This is the time between when you are first infected and when the test can accurately detect the virus. If you test negative during the window period, you may still be infected. It's important to get retested after the window period has passed if you have any concerns about possible exposure to HIV.

### Positive Result

A positive HIV test result means that antibodies or antigens to HIV were detected in your sample. This usually means you are infected with HIV.

**Important note:** A positive result on an initial HIV test will need to be confirmed with a follow-up test. This is to ensure the accuracy of the result.

## The Window Period

The window period is the time it takes for your body to produce enough antibodies or antigens for an HIV test to detect the virus. The window period varies depending on the type of test:

*   **Antibody tests:**  The window period for most antibody tests is 3 to 12 weeks.
*   **Antigen/antibody tests:**  These tests have a shorter window period, typically 2 to 6 weeks.
*   **RNA tests:**  RNA tests can detect HIV as early as 10 days after infection, but they are not typically used for initial screening.

If you have any concerns about possible HIV exposure, talk to your doctor about the appropriate testing timeline.

## Confirmatory Tests

If you receive a positive result on an initial HIV test, a confirmatory test will be done to verify the result. Common confirmatory tests include:

*   **Western blot:**  This test is highly accurate and confirms the presence of specific HIV antibodies.
*   **Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA):**  This test also detects HIV antibodies.

## What to Do After a Positive Test Result

If your HIV test is confirmed positive, it's important to:

*   **Seek medical care:**  Talk to your doctor or a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can help you understand your treatment options and connect you with support services.
*   **Start treatment:**  Starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) early can help you stay healthy and prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS.
*   **Take steps to prevent transmission:**  Learn about safe sex practices and other ways to prevent transmitting HIV to others.
*   **Find support:**  Connect with friends, family, or support groups for emotional support.

**Remember:**  A positive HIV test result is not a death sentence. With effective treatment, people with HIV can live long and healthy lives.
