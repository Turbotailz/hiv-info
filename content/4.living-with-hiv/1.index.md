Thanks to advances in medicine, HIV is now a manageable chronic condition. This page provides information about treatment options for HIV, focusing on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

## Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)

ART is the cornerstone of HIV treatment. It involves taking a combination of medications that work together to suppress the virus and prevent it from damaging your immune system.

**How ART Works:**

ART medications target different stages of the HIV life cycle, preventing the virus from replicating and spreading. This helps to:

*   Reduce the amount of HIV in your body (viral load)
*   Increase your CD4+ T cell count (a measure of immune system health)
*   Prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS
*   Reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others

**Benefits of ART:**

*   Improved quality of life
*   Increased life expectancy
*   Reduced risk of opportunistic infections
*   Prevention of HIV transmission

## Different Drug Classes

ART medications are grouped into different classes based on how they work:

*   **Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs):**  These drugs interfere with HIV's ability to convert its RNA into DNA.
*   **Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs):**  These drugs also block reverse transcription, but in a different way than NRTIs.
*   **Protease inhibitors (PIs):**  These drugs prevent HIV from assembling new viral particles.
*   **Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs):**  These drugs block HIV from integrating its DNA into your cells' DNA.
*   **Entry inhibitors:** These drugs prevent HIV from entering your cells.
*   **Fusion inhibitors:** These drugs prevent HIV from fusing with your cells' membrane.

## Treatment Regimens

Your doctor will work with you to determine the best ART regimen for your individual needs. Most people start with a combination of three medications from at least two different drug classes.

**Factors that influence treatment choice:**

*   Your overall health
*   Your CD4+ T cell count
*   Your viral load
*   Potential side effects
*   Drug resistance testing

## Drug Resistance

Over time, HIV can develop resistance to ART medications. This means the drugs become less effective at suppressing the virus.

**Preventing drug resistance:**

*   Take your medications exactly as prescribed.
*   Don't skip doses or stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor.
*   Get regular viral load tests to monitor your treatment.

If you develop drug resistance, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment regimen.

## Side Effects of ART

ART medications can cause side effects, but most are manageable. Common side effects include:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Rash

More serious side effects are rare but can include:

*   Kidney problems
*   Liver problems
*   Heart problems
*   Bone loss

Talk to your doctor if you experience any side effects from your medication.

## Adherence to ART

Adherence to ART is crucial for successful treatment. This means taking your medication exactly as prescribed, every day.

**Tips for improving adherence:**

*   Use a pill organizer.
*   Set reminders on your phone or calendar.
*   Talk to your doctor if you have trouble taking your medication.

**Remember:**  With effective treatment and adherence to ART, people with HIV can live long and healthy lives.
