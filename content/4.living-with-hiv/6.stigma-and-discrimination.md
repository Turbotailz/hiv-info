Despite advances in treatment and prevention, people with HIV still face stigma and discrimination. This page explores the harmful effects of stigma and how we can work together to end it.

## What is HIV Stigma?

HIV stigma refers to negative attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors towards people with HIV. It can manifest in many ways, including:

*   Fear of casual contact with people with HIV
*   Discrimination in employment, housing, and healthcare
*   Social isolation and rejection
*   Internalized stigma (negative feelings about oneself)

Stigma and discrimination against people with HIV remain significant challenges. These harmful attitudes and behaviors can prevent people from getting tested, accessing treatment, and living full lives.

## The Impact of HIV Stigma

HIV stigma can have serious consequences for people with HIV, including:

*   Reduced access to testing and treatment
*   Poor mental health and well-being
*   Difficulty forming and maintaining relationships
*   Increased risk behaviors (due to fear of disclosure)

## How to Combat HIV Stigma

We all have a role to play in ending HIV stigma. Here are some ways you can help:

*   **Educate yourself:** Learn the facts about HIV and challenge misconceptions.
*   **Speak out:** If you hear someone making stigmatizing comments, speak up and correct them.
*   **Show compassion:** Treat people with HIV with respect and empathy.
*   **Support organizations:** Support organizations working to end HIV stigma and discrimination.
*   **Share your story:** If you are living with HIV, sharing your story can help to challenge stereotypes and humanize the issue.

## Challenging Internalized Stigma

If you are living with HIV, it's important to address any internalized stigma you may be experiencing. Remember:

*   You are not alone. Many people with HIV struggle with internalized stigma.
*   HIV does not define you. You are a valuable and worthy person, regardless of your HIV status.
*   Seek support. Talk to a therapist, counselor, or support group about your feelings.

**Together, we can create a world free from HIV stigma and discrimination.**
