Preventing HIV transmission is crucial for both individual and public health. This page provides information on effective methods to reduce the risk of HIV infection.

## Key HIV Prevention Strategies

### Safe Sex Practices

Practicing safe sex is one of the most effective ways to prevent HIV transmission. This includes:

*   **Using condoms:** Condoms are a barrier method that prevents the exchange of bodily fluids during sex. Use condoms consistently and correctly every time you have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral).
*   **Choosing less risky sexual activities:** Certain sexual activities carry a higher risk of HIV transmission than others. For example, receptive anal sex has a higher risk than vaginal sex.
*   **Limiting your number of sexual partners:** The more sexual partners you have, the higher your risk of HIV exposure.
*   **Talking to your partner(s) about HIV:** Open and honest communication about HIV status and testing is essential for safe sex.
*   **Getting tested for STIs:**  Having other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase the risk of HIV transmission. Get tested regularly for STIs and seek treatment if needed.
*   **Using lubricant:**  Water-based or silicone-based lubricants can reduce friction during sex, which can help prevent condoms from breaking.

### PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis)

PrEP is a medication that people at high risk of HIV can take to prevent HIV infection. It involves taking a daily pill containing antiretroviral drugs.

**Who should consider PrEP?**

*   People who have a sexual partner with HIV
*   People who have multiple sexual partners
*   People who inject drugs
*   People who have a history of STIs

**Effectiveness:** When taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV transmission.

**Important notes about PrEP:**

*   PrEP needs to be taken consistently every day to be effective.
*   PrEP does not protect against other STIs, so it's important to use condoms as well.
*   PrEP requires regular medical checkups and HIV testing.

### PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)

PEP is a medication that can be taken after a potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection. It must be started within 72 hours of exposure and involves taking antiretroviral drugs daily for 28 days.

**Who should consider PEP?**

*   Healthcare workers who have been exposed to HIV-infected blood
*   People who have had unprotected sex with someone who has HIV or whose HIV status is unknown
*   People who have shared needles or other drug injection equipment

**Effectiveness:** PEP is most effective when started as soon as possible after exposure.

**Important notes about PEP:**

*   PEP is not 100% effective in preventing HIV.
*   PEP can have side effects.
*   PEP is not a substitute for regular HIV prevention methods.

### Harm Reduction for People Who Inject Drugs

Harm reduction strategies aim to reduce the negative consequences associated with drug use, including HIV transmission. These strategies include:

*   **Needle exchange programs:**  Provide access to clean needles and syringes to prevent sharing.
*   **Safe injection sites:**  Supervised facilities where people can inject drugs in a safe and hygienic environment.
*   **Overdose prevention education:**  Training on recognizing and responding to drug overdoses.
*   **Substance abuse treatment:**  Connecting people who use drugs with treatment programs to help them reduce or stop their drug use.

## Additional Prevention Strategies

*   **Male circumcision:**  Male circumcision can reduce the risk of HIV transmission during vaginal sex.
*   **HIV testing and counseling:**  Regular HIV testing and counseling can help identify people with HIV and link them to care and treatment, which can help prevent further transmission.
*   **Education and awareness:** Increasing knowledge and awareness about HIV and its prevention is crucial for empowering individuals to make informed choices about their health.
