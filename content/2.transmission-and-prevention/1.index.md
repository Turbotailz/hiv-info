Understanding how HIV is transmitted is crucial for prevention. This page provides detailed information on the different ways HIV can be spread.

## Ways HIV Can Be Transmitted

HIV is transmitted through certain bodily fluids from a person who has HIV. These fluids are:

*   Blood
*   Semen
*   Vaginal fluids
*   Breast milk

HIV can enter the body through:

*   Breaks in the skin or mucous membranes (e.g., cuts, sores)
*   Direct injection into the bloodstream (e.g., sharing needles)

### Sexual Transmission

HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact with someone who has HIV. The risk of transmission varies depending on the type of sexual activity:

*   **Anal sex:**  Receptive anal sex carries the highest risk of HIV transmission. This is because the lining of the rectum is thin and can tear easily, allowing HIV to enter the bloodstream.
*   **Vaginal sex:**  HIV can be transmitted through vaginal sex, though the risk is lower than with anal sex.
*   **Oral sex:**  The risk of HIV transmission through oral sex is very low, but it is still possible.

**Factors that increase the risk of sexual transmission:**

*   Having multiple sexual partners
*   Having unprotected sex (without condoms)
*   Having a sexually transmitted infection (STI)

### Blood-to-Blood Contact

HIV can be transmitted through direct contact with the blood of someone who has HIV. This can occur through:

*   **Sharing needles:** Sharing needles or other drug injection equipment is a very high-risk activity for HIV transmission.
*   **Needle stick injuries:** Healthcare workers can be at risk of HIV transmission if they accidentally prick themselves with a needle contaminated with HIV-infected blood.
*   **Blood transfusions:** In rare cases, HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusions. However, blood banks now rigorously screen all donated blood for HIV, making this risk extremely low.

### Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT)

HIV can be transmitted from a mother with HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. This is known as vertical transmission or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).

**Preventing MTCT:**

*   **Antiretroviral therapy (ART):**  Taking ART during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly reduces the risk of MTCT.
*   **Cesarean delivery:** In some cases, a cesarean delivery may be recommended to reduce the risk of transmission during childbirth.
*   **Avoiding breastfeeding:** In countries where safe alternatives are available, mothers with HIV are advised not to breastfeed.

## Ways HIV is NOT Transmitted

It's important to emphasize that HIV is NOT transmitted through:

*   Casual contact (hugging, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.)
*   Air or water
*   Insects
*   Saliva, tears, or sweat

## Reducing the Risk of HIV Transmission

*   **Practice safe sex:** Use condoms consistently and correctly every time you have sex.
*   **Get tested for HIV:** Know your HIV status and encourage your partners to get tested as well.
*   **Consider PrEP:** If you are at high risk of HIV, talk to your doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
*   **Don't share needles:** Never share needles or other drug injection equipment.
*   **If you are pregnant and have HIV:** Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
